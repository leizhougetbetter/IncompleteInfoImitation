There are two folders titled *with personal information* and *without personal information*.
The codes applies to Fig. 5 in the main text. The files for simulations are explained in the folder for Fig 2 and Fig 3. 

## with personal information

There is no need to specify the value of $\theta$ in *inputParameters.inp*. The code applies to situations with $\theta=1/(1+s_i)$.

In *sNumNeighobrInput.txt*, we provide a demo for Uniform distribution of the amount of social information $s_i$.

## without personal information

There is no need to specify the value of $\theta$ in *inputParameters.inp*. The code applies to situations with $\theta=0$.

In *sNumNeighobrInput.txt*, we provide a demo for Gasussian distribution of the amount of social information $s_i$.
